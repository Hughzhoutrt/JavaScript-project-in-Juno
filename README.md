# JavaScript_projectInJuno
This project is re uploaded on Sep 12, 2021 because my misusing git and my repository did not work properly.  
When I figured out how to fix it, I alreayd empty and reset this document. The cost of learning...    
My break timer is built during the second half of Aug (due on Aug 29) then I started working on my second project in Juno JavaScript course.  
After some brainstorms and idea changes, I am building my weather network from this weekend.

YUHUI'S BREAK TIMER  
My break timer is a counting down based on user's input: both shortcut click function and number input are allowed.  
In addition, users can input the time they want to count down, or the time they want to be alerted (I call it "Be-back" function).  
I set shortcut buttons for lunch time, work break, coffee time, pomodoro, plus/reduce a min/sec.  
All acts on my app will be logged and they can be marked as important marks.  
Three themes could be selected while two languages are provided.  
Please feel free to share with me if you have any idea about improving the practicability of this break timer :).
